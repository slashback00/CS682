    <h2>Function: airsim_follow</h2>
    <p>Initializes a ROS node and starts the AirSim drone to follow a predefined trajectory based on the received spline marker array.</p>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Starts ROS with the <code>rospy.init_node('airsim_follow_trajectory')</code> command.</li>
        <li>Sets a global velocity parameter, which can be adjusted via ROS.</li>
        <li>Subscribes to the <code>/trajectory/spline_marker_array</code> topic to receive the path for the drone.</li>
        <li>Keeps the node running with <code>rospy.spin()</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Parameters:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="parameter">velocity:</span> A global variable set to define the drone's movement speed. It's set by default to 0.5 but can be adjusted via the <code>/velocity</code> ROS parameter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subscriptions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="parameter">/trajectory/spline_marker_array (MarkerArray):</span> The drone subscribes to this topic to receive the trajectory path defined as a marker array. It's essential for the drone's path following behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>Invoke this function to start the AirSim drone simulation with ROS, enabling it to follow a trajectory based on the received spline marker array.</p>

    <h2>Initial Connection to AirSim</h2>
    <p>Establishes a connection with the AirSim simulator and enables API control for sending commands to the multirotor client.</p>
    
    <h3>Code Overview:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initializes the connection to the AirSim simulator using the <code>airsim.MultirotorClient()</code> class.</li>
        <li>Confirms the connection with <code>client.confirmConnection()</code>.</li>
        <li>Enables API control to allow command sending with <code>client.enableApiControl(True)</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Function: trajectory_callback</h2>
    <p>Defines the behavior for following a trajectory based on a received spline marker array message. It calculates the path and commands the drone to move accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Parameters:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="parameter">spline_marker_array_msg:</span> The received marker array message containing the trajectory points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculates the number of trajectories received.</li>
        <li>Initializes an empty list for the following path.</li>
        <li>Iterates over the points in the last published trajectory, converting them into a format suitable for AirSim and adding them to the path queue.</li>
        <li>Commands the client to move along the calculated path using <code>client.moveOnPathAsync()</code> with specified parameters including velocity and drivetrain type.</li>
        <li>Disables API control after the path is followed with <code>client.enableApiControl(False)</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>This callback function is triggered upon receiving a new spline marker array message. It processes the message to command the drone to follow the specified trajectory. Typically used within a ROS environment where such messages are published.</p>
